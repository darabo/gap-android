# Gap Mesh User Guide

Welcome to Gap Mesh! This guide will help you get started with the app, even if you're not familiar with technology.

## What is Gap Mesh?

Gap Mesh is a **messaging app that works without the internet**. It connects your phone directly to nearby phones using Bluetooth, creating a "mesh network" – like a chain of people passing messages to each other.

### Why Use Gap Mesh?

- ✅ **No internet needed** – Chat when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data
- ✅ **No phone number required** – Stay anonymous
- ✅ **No accounts** – Just install and start chatting
- ✅ **Private & secure** – Your private messages are encrypted
- ✅ **Works anywhere** – Protests, remote areas, emergencies, or just with friends nearby

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the App

Download Gap Mesh from:

- **Google Play Store**: Search for "Gap Mesh"
- **Direct Download**: Available on our GitHub releases page

### Step 2: Grant Permissions

When you first open the app, it will ask for some permissions. Here's why each one is needed:

| Permission        | Why It's Needed                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bluetooth**     | To discover and connect with nearby Gap Mesh users                                |
| **Location**      | Required by Android to scan for Bluetooth devices (we don't track your location!) |
| **Notifications** | To alert you when you receive new messages                                        |

> 💡 **Privacy Note**: Gap Mesh does NOT track or store your location. Location permission is only required by Android for Bluetooth scanning.

### Step 3: Choose Your Nickname

Pick a nickname that others will see when you chat. You can change it anytime!

### Step 4: Disable Battery Optimization (Recommended)

Android may stop Gap Mesh from running in the background to save battery. This can cause you to miss messages.

When prompted, tap **"Disable Battery Optimization"** to ensure reliable messaging.
